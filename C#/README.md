This is my C# code.



areacalculator.cs - This C# program calculates the area of different shapes (circle, square, rectangle) 
based on user input. It uses a switch statement to handle different cases and calculates the area accordingly.


Guessinggame.cs - This C# program is a simple number guessing game. It generates a random number and asks the user 
to guess it, providing hints along the way. It keeps track of the number of attempts and congratulates the user
when they guess correctly.
